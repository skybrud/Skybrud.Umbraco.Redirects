## Import & Export

The [**Skybrud Redirect Import**](https://github.com/skybrud/Skybrud.Umbraco.Redirects.Import) package adds support for importing and exporting redirects. Eg. if you're building a new site, you can import a CSV or XLSX file with redirects for the most important URLs on the old site.
